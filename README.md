Rock Paper Scissors

This was part of The Odin Project's lessons on JavaScript. It utilized what we had learned so far
in order to create a primitive rock-paper-scissors type game. I enjoyed programming the game, and
it went suprisingly smoothly after I thought about each part of the game individiually. I encountered
errors along the way, but they helped me because through googling I got a better understanding of
how functions interact with each other.
